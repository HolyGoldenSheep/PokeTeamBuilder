Despite the danger, it wants to come up on land, so it does its best to waddle along, but when an enemy finds it, it rushes back to the water.

Despite its thinness, its skin is flexible and slimy, so even sharp fangs bounce off of it. The direction of its spiral tends to differ by area. Poliwag experts can tell them apart at a glance. In rivers with fast-flowing water, it will cling to a rock by using its lips, which act like a suction cup."
PoliwhirlNyorozo(ニョロゾ)(0061),"Poliwhirl is among the most-marketed Pokémon.[40][41]It can live in or out of the water, but prefers living in water where, it has fewer natural enemies and more plentiful prey. When out of water, it constantly sweats so its body is always wet and slick with an oily fluid. Because of this, it can easily slip out of the clutches of its enemies. Its health suffers when its skin dries out, so trainers have to keep it moist. It goes on land in search of bug Pokémon, then takes them underwater so it can safely eat them.

If the Shellder were to detach itself from Slowbro in any way, it will devolve back to Slowpoke. Being slow-witted to begin with, the Slowbro does not feel pain in its tail because of Shellder's seeping poison.

It is attracted to electromagnetic waves from devices such as Pokégears, and attaches itself to power breakers. Power outages not caused by storms could be the result of a colony of Magnemite feeding on it. It becomes incapable of flight if it out of electricity. The two magnets on its side are powerful enough to draw in iron objects from up to 300 feet away, and get stronger the faster they spin. Touching it while it is eating electricity will give a full body shock. Its numbers have been decreasing because most modern power lines are buried under the ground."

Groups of Magneton tend to gather where sun flares happen. Exposure to one can cause earaches. Its magnetism is so powerful it dries up moisture in its vicinity, and is potentially fatal to devices like TVs. As a result, large cities have sirens to warn their citizens of Magneton appearances, and trainers are warned to keep Magneton inside their Poké Balls.

If they cannot agree on something to do or overthink their plans, they will be unable to move. When two heads sleep, one head remains awake. It has three hearts and six lungs, giving it increased endurance, so while it is slower than Doduo, it can run for longer periods of time."
SeelPauwau(パウワウ)(0086),"It loves swimming around in 14 °F waters. Its horn is hard enough to bash its way through ice. It has a thick hide covered in warm fur. It goes in waters up to -40 °F. Though not a great walker, it is a skilled swimmer. It closes its nostrils when it swims. In the daytime, it can be found sleeping on the seabed of shallow waters. Their presence in the Alolan climate is considered a mystery."
DewgongJugon(ジュゴン)(0087),"Dewgong can store thermal energy in its body to withstand cold temperatures. At night, it hunts for prey likeWishiwashi, and during the day, it sleeps on ice or shallow water, or sunbathes on beaches. A fisherman once mistook a Dewgong on an iceberg for a mermaid."
GrimerBetobetā(ベトベター)(0088),"Being mostly composed of poisonous filth, it can squeeze into sewage pipes with ease. Grimer lived mostly in urban cities, factories, and lakes, where it could find waste to consume, though environmental improvements have caused its population to start dwindling. It has a Poison/Dark-typeAlolan form."
MukBetobeton(ベトベトン)(0089),"It is based on the dorotabō, a one-eyed, three-fingeredyōkaithat rises from the mud of neglected, overgrown rice fields. Muk is covered in a toxic filthy sludge so vile that any land it walks through becomes inhospitable for up to three years. A drop of its body fluid can turn a pool rancid or leave a person bedridden for days. Its nose has devolved, so it cannot smell anything. It feeds on anything repugnant and filthy, like sewer water. Its numbers have started declining since people have begun cleaning up towns, and because some people think it may go extinct, sludge pools are being built to prevent this. Like Grimer, it has a Poison/Dark-typeAlolan form."
ShellderSherudā(シェルダー)(0090),"Tugging on its tongue, which is always sticking out, will startle it into opening its shell. It opens and closes its shell in rapid succession to propel itself backwards. Shellder have been known to seek out Slowpoke's tails, inadvertently causing them to evolve into Slowbro. Biting its head will instead cause it to evolve into Slowking. It and Cloyster are related to theShellosline."
CloysterParushen(パルシェン)(0091),It normally keeps its shell closed unless it is attacking. It uses the same projectile system — swallowing seawater and ejecting it from the front or rear — to shoot its spikes and swim. Its internal anatomy has yet to be seen.
GastlyGōsu(ゴース)(0092),"It hides under structures to stop the wind from blowing away its gaseous body. It engulfs prey of any size with its gas, poisoning it through its skin or suffocating it."
HaunterGōsuto(ゴースト)(0093),"Because of its ability to slip through walls, Haunter is said to be from another dimension. It saps its victims' life by licking them with its cold, gaseous tongue. Those licked by it grow weaker with each passing day, shaking uncontrollably until they die. If one trips and falls for no apparent reason or hear a sound when no one is around, it may be a Haunter. Because it fears the light and revels in the dark, it may be on the verge of extinction in cities that stay brightly lit at night. On moonless nights, Haunter searches for someone to curse."
GengarGengā(ゲンガー)(0094),"Gengar seeps into the shadows of people and Pokémon to scare them for fun or eat their life force. A sudden chill of 10 °F or cooler may be a Gengar trying to curse someone. Gengar will lurk in whatever dark corner of a room it can find and wait for its chance to catch its prey. It likes to attack people in mountains. Sometimes, Gengar will pose as people's shadows. It apparently wishes for a traveling companion. Since it may have once been human, it tries to create one by taking the lives of other humans. Initially created bySatoshi TajiriandKen Sugimori,[50][51]it has become one of the most popular Pokémon, placing tenth on theGooglePokémon of the Year 2020poll.[52]Kotaku'sZack Zwiezen said Gengar was ""one of [their] favorite gen 1 designs"", calling it a ""great design [because] it's simple, yet not boring or generic"".[53]Gengar has appeared in many Pokémon spin-offs or crossovers, includingPokkén Tournament[54]andPokémon Unite.[55]It gained aMega Evolutionin generation VI and aGigantamax formin generation VIII."
OnixIwāku(イワーク)(0095),"It usually lives underground. As it grows, the stone portions of its body harden to become similar to a diamond, but colored black. Despite its large body being over 26 feet long, it can squirm its way through the ground at 50 mph. As it digs through the ground, it eats hard objects, which makes its body more solid. Diglett may use the tunnels it burrows as homes. Onix has a magnet in its brain, which acts as a compass so that it does not lose direction while it is tunneling. As it grows older, its body becomes increasingly rounder and smoother. It evolves into Steelix when traded while holding a Metal Coat.[8][56][57][58]While its Defense and Speed are high, Onix' other values are deceptively low, making it a relatively weak Rock-type choice compared to Golem and Rhydon.[59]"
DrowzeeSurīpu(スリープ)(0096),"Drowzee's design is based on the dream-eatingtapirBaku. It puts people to sleep with its hypnotism and eats their dreams through their noses. It can get sick from eating nightmares. If one sleeps by it frequently, it might show them dreams it ate in the past. If someone has forgotten their dreams, Drowzee may have eaten them. It remembers every dream it has eaten, and rarely eats the dreams of adults because children's are tastier."
HypnoSurīpā(スリーパー)(0097),"Hypno's design is based on the dream-eatingtapirBakuand ahypnotist. Hypno holds a pendulum in its hand.[60]Allegedly, there once was an incident in which it took away a child it hypnotized.[61]When hungry, it puts humans it meets to sleep, then feasts on their dreams and carries away anyone having good dreams. Hypno sometimes aid doctors in putting patients to sleep, but other members of the species enjoy feasting on good dreams and kidnap those who have them.[62]Since its inception, Hypno has been regarded for its dark backstory, primarily its child-abducting tendencies.[61]Its humanoid design has been cited as creepy, and a reason why its design was considered unappealing.[63]Hypno's child abducting tendencies resulted in a popularcreepypasta, dubbed ""Hypno's Lullaby"" being created, which centered around a song focusing on Hypno as achild thief.[63][64]Hypno's Lullaby was adapted into several playable adaptations, notablyROM hacks.[65][66][67]"
KrabbyKurabu(クラブ)(0098),"Krabby and Kingler live near the edge of water, usually in beaches. It can shroud its body in foam to look bigger than it is. If damaged or lost in battle, its pincers grow back quickly, though it has trouble balancing without them."
KinglerKingurā(キングラー)(0099),"Its left claw has grown twice as big as its right, and is now strong enough to break Cloyster shells open. However, swinging it can cause balancing issues and tire it out. Kingler are said to communicate with each other by waving their pincers around. It gained aGigantamax formin generation VIII."
VoltorbBiriridama(ビリリダマ)(0100),"It is believed that Voltorb was created when a Poké Ball was hit with an energy pulse. When agitated or tapped, it will explode. Sometimes, humans will mistake a stray Voltorb for a Poké Ball, touch it, and get shocked or exploded. It has an Electric/Grass-typeHisuian form."
ElectrodeMarumain(マルマイン)(0101),"Electrode resembles an upside-down Poké Ball, though its actual relation to them has yet to be confirmed. Unlike Voltorb, it can control its explosions, but will still explode at any time and for any reason. Groups of Electrode live in power plants and eat their electricity, causing blackouts. Like Voltorb, it has an Electric/Grass-typeHisuian form."
ExeggcuteTamatama(タマタマ)(0102),"Though it may look like eggs, Exeggcute are actually clusters of seeds. When cracks increasingly appear on the seeds, Exeggcute is close to evolution. When disturbed, they quickly gather and attack in swarms. If one is separated from the group, the six will quickly regroup with telepathy. Although they are the same size as others, Alolan Exeggcute are heavier than others, as their shells are packed full. They are often hunted by Pidgeotto and Crabrawler, but uses psychokinesis to drive it off."
ExeggutorNasshī(ナッシー)(0103),"It is acoconut tree-esque Pokémon based on thejinmenju, and the favorite Pokémon ofTsunekazu Ishihara, president and CEO ofThe Pokémon Company, having used it throughout the debugging phase ofPokémon RedandGreen.[68]Its three heads think independently of each other, and become unable to act if they disagree on what to do. They communicate via telepathy. Sometimes, one of the heads grows so big that it falls off and becomes an Exeggcute. Its cries are noisy due to each head thinking about something else. Exeggutor are friendly, and only engage their enemies with psychic power when they need to. It has a Grass/Dragon-typeAlolan form."
CuboneKarakara(カラカラ)(0104),"Cubone wears the skull of its deceased mother. Since it never removes said skull, no one has ever seen Cubone's real face. The stains on the skull it wears are made by the tears it sheds. When it thinks of its deceased mother, it weeps loudly, andMandibuzzthat hear its cries will attack it from the air. Its name is a combination of ""cub"" and ""bone"".[10]"
MarowakGaragara(ガラガラ)(0105),"The bone it holds is its key weapon. It throws the bone like a boomerang to knock out targets. Originally a Cubone, it overcame its mother's death and became rough and aggressive. Some say that a Marowak graveyard exists somewhere in the world. It carries out vengeance on its natural enemy, Mandibuzz, as it throws bones to try to take it down. They thump their bones rhythmically to communicate among themselves, with nearly 50 different rhythmic patterns. It has a Ghost/Fire-typeAlolan form."
HitmonleeSawamurā(サワムラー)(0106),"Hitmonlee's design is based onheadless men. It may also be based onKabandha. Its English name is derived from actor and martial artistBruce Lee,[10]while its Japanese name is derived from kickboxerTadashi Sawamura. When in a hurry, its legs strengthen progressively. Its balance lets it attack from any stance. Some call it the ""Kick Master"". After a battle, it rubs down its springy legs to overcome fatigue. Its legs can stretch to double its length. Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan did not have a distinct evolutionary line until Tyrogue and Hitmontop were conceived. Hitmonlee evolves from Tyrogue if it has higher Attack than Defense."
HitmonchanEbiwarā(エビワラー)(0107),"Its English name is derived from actor and martial artistJackie Chan,[10]while its Japanese name is derived from boxerHiroyuki Ebihara. It can punch fast enough to slice air and hard enough to break rocks, though it needs to rest for a couple minutes after doing so. It winds it arms to punch harder, and punches in a corkscrew fashion. A Hitmonchan is said to possess the spirit of a boxer who had been working towards a world championship. It evolves from Tyrogue if it has higher Defense than Attack."
LickitungBeroringa(ベロリンガ)(0108),"Instead of its hands, it uses its long, prehensile tongue. It paralyzes bug Pokémon by licking them, and eats them whole. If not immediately washed, its licks can cause itchy rashes. Its tongue can stretch up to 6 inches, and when it does, its tail quivers and contracts. It has nerves that run through its tongue, so it can use it freely. It licks filthy things to clean them, but its saliva is still smelly and grimy, so they do not end up much cleaner. Whenever Lickitung comes across something new, it licks it to memorize the taste and texture of that thing. When its saliva is boiled, it becomes a strong adhesive."
KoffingDogāsu(ドガース)(0109),"Koffing is based onair pollutionand meteorites. It mixes its toxins with the rotting trash it eats to make poisonous gases. Sometimes, it can over-inflate itself and explode."

Its two heads have different toxins, and it makes its poisonous gas stronger and smellier by pushing it between said heads. It has a Poison/Fairy-typeGalarian form. Despite this, Kantonian Weezing were once a common sight in Galar, and produced stronger gases than other regions' Weezing."
RhyhornSaihōn(サイホーン)(0111),"Because it is not good at turning, Rhyhorn runs in a straight line, destroying anything in its way. Though it can knock a block of steel down without much care, its head may be sore the next day. Its massive bones are 1,000 times harder than those of humans, and it can easily send a trailer flying. As a Pokémon with a one-track mind, when it starts running, it will not stop until it falls asleep. Rhyhorn's brain is so small and dense that it usually forgets why it may be running."
RhydonSaidon(サイドン)(0112),"Rhydon was the first Pokémon created by Game Freak.[69]Unlike Rhyhorn, it is bipedal. Protected by an armor-like hide, it can survive in lava over 3,600 °F (1,980 °C) and take direct hits from cannonballs.

KangaskhanGarūra(ガルーラ)(0115),"The female raises its young in its belly pouch for around three years, and during this time, the baby rarely ventures out. The young leaves home once it learns to find food, and its mother begins to miss it. To avoid crushing the baby, it sleeps standing up.

They live in groups. It gained aMega Evolutionin generation VI."
HorseaTattsū(タッツー)(0116),"Horsea and Seadra are based onseahorses.[70]It feeds on bug Pokémon and moss. It can fire water from its mouth to attack foes in or out of water, or ink to deter attackers. By spinning its body, it can create whirlpools."
SeadraShīdora(シードラ)(0117),"It can swim in any direction by flapping its fins and tail. It creates whirlpools to exhaust its prey, and eats it whole. Male Seadra will take care of newborn Horsea. While doing so, the poison on the tips of its fins becomes thicker and stronger than usual."
GoldeenTosakinto(トサキント)(0118),"Goldeen and Seaking are based ongoldfish.[70]Goldeen was originally intended to have a pre-evolution called ""Gyopin"", but it was cut from the game due to a lack of cartridge space.[71]If kept in an aquarium, it will use its horn to break out. Swimmers have to be careful in water, so that Goldeen do not ram into them."
SeakingAzumaō(アズマオウ)(0119),Seaking is known to be able to swim against streams and up waterfalls. It will use its horn to bore holes into rocks to lay eggs in. Fans of Seaking's horn and fins are known to fight each other.

StarmieSutāmī(スターミー)(0121),"Starmie has a second star on its back, which is semi-attached and able to spin around independently of the front star. Starmie has a red jewel core, which resembles a cut precious stone and seems to shine with the seven colors of therainbowwhen looked at from different angles, but usually shows up red more than any other color.

While young, they live together deep in the mountains, training themselves in fighting with their scythes and moving at high speeds."
JynxRūjura(ルージュラ)(0124),"Jynx has spawned controversy due to aspects of its design being similar toblackface, leading Game Freak to change the color of its skin from black to purple.[75][76][77][78][79]WhenPokémon Yellowwas rereleased on theNintendo 3DSVirtual Console, the in-game sprite of Jynx was edited to reflect this change.[79]Jynx's appearance is a purple humanoid with blond hair and a dress. It can put opponents to sleep by kissing them. Jynx can communicate with what appears to be a human-like language, though it has yet to be deciphered, so they usually opt to communicate with dance-like movement instead."
ElectabuzzErebū(エレブー)(0125),"Groups of Electabuzz gather near power plants or places likely to be struck by thunder to feast on electricity. For this reason, they are often placed in houses as lightning rods. Power plants employ the use of Ground-type Pokémon to prevent Electabuzz from eating their energy and causing blackouts, though they are usually the fault of the companies running them. In the dark, it glows a whitish-blue color."
MagmarBūbā(ブーバー)(0126),"While Magmar was voted the eighth best fire-type Pokémon by theOfficial Nintendo Magazinereaders,[80]GamesRadar had criticized its design multiple times, noting that its forehead resembles a butt.[81][82]Magmar are found in and around active volcanoes. Its body temperature is 2,200 °F. It dislikes cold places, so it blows flames to make the environment suitable for itself. Its appearance is often obscured by the flames that cover it. It can heal and rest itself by dipping its body into lava. In battle, Magmar blows out flames from all over its body to intimidate its opponent. When it breathes, its temperature rises, and when it sneezes, flames shoot out. Magmar dispatches its prey with fire, but may accidentally burn said prey to a charred crisp."
PinsirKairosu(カイロス)(0127),"It was originally supposed to have an evolution called ""Plux"" in generation II. Some speculated that this unused design was reworked into Heracross.[83]Pinsir can use its pincers to crush, toss, bludgeon, or tear anything up to twice its size. Captured prey is kept in place by the piercing thorns and sheer strength of Pinsir's horns, and will not be released until they are torn in half. If it cannot be torn in half, it tosses it around. In addition to hunting prey, it also tends to enjoy tree sap. Pinsir live in temperate forests or jungles, and burrow their way underground or inside trees to avoid the cold. In Alola, it has a rivalry with Vikavolt, yet gets along with Heracross. In other regions, however, it competes with Heracross for food. Pinsir are known to judge each other based on their pincers, which also determine its popularity with the opposite gender based on how thick it looks. It gained aMega Evolutionin generation VI."
TaurosKentarosu(ケンタロス)(0128),"When attacking, it violently charges while whipping itself with its three tails. Like Rhyhorn, it will not stop running until it hits something. Although powerful, it can only charge in a straight line. They fight each other by locking horns to prove their strength, and the leader prides itself with its battle-scarred horns. If there are no opponents, it will charge into thick trees, knocking them down. Historically, people have ridden Tauros for ages, a practice said to have started in Alola. Tauros in Alola actually have a calm side, most likely due to the climate. Tauros in Galar, however, are more volatile and will not let people ride them. It hasthree Paldean forms."
MagikarpKoikingu(コイキング)(0129),"Magikarp is mostly useless in the games, until it evolves into Gyarados. Magikarp is based on thecommon carp.[70]At level 15, Magikarp learns Tackle. Until then, it only knows Splash and cannot be taught any other moves. In the distant past, it was somewhat stronger than the descendants that exist today. Despite its weakness, it is actually a hardy and fertile Pokémon that can survive in any body of water. Its swimming muscles are weak, so it gets easily washed away by currents, so places where water pools like seas, lakes, rivers, and shallow puddles will have many Magikarp stuck in them. It may jump on rare occasions, but never more than seven feet, making it easy for predators like Pidgeotto to catch it mid-jump. In rare occasions, a Magikarp living for many years can leap up a mountain."
GyaradosGyaradosu(ギャラドス)(0130),"When Magikarp evolves into Gyarados, its brain cells undergo a structural transformation, said to be the cause of its violent nature. Throughout history, it would appear and burn down cities, villages, and towns in rampages lasting around a month. There are some regions where it is called ""the deity of destruction"". Despite its Flying type, Gyarados cannot actually fly. It gained aMega Evolutionin generation VI."
LaprasRapurasu(ラプラス)(0131),"Lapras have gentle hearts. Poachers drove Lapras to the point of near-extinction, though recent protection regulations have instead made it an overabundant species. It loves transporting people on its back, and can actually understand human speech thanks to its high intelligence. Lapras will sing with other Lapras as a form of communication, or by itself when happy. Lapras is based on theLoch Ness Monsterand the plesiosaur, and in early versions ofRedandBluewas named ""Ness"".[84]It gained aGigantamax formin generation VIII. Many regions in Japan have utilized Lapras' image to encourage tourism.[85][86][87]Lapras has been well received by critics, and has appeared on several lists of the best Pokémon of all time.[88][89][90]"
DittoMetamon(メタモン)(0132),"Appearing as an amorphous blob, Ditto is capable of transforming into an exact copy of anything it sees by altering its genetic code. However, this transformation is often imperfect.[91]The specific imperfections vary from Ditto to Ditto. It does not get along with others of the same species, as they will both fruitlessly try to transform into each other. Ditto rose in popularity withGoldandSilver, where it was able to ""breed"" with any other Pokémon that is able to breed, becoming vital for the franchise'scompetitive scene. It cannot breed with itself, though.[92]Due to its similarities toMew, a longtime rumor arose that it was a failed clone. However, this fan theory has been denied by Game Freak.[93]"
EeveeĪbui(イーブイ)(0133),"Eevee is often considered among the ""cutest"" Pokémon in the franchise.[94][95][96][97]Due to this, Eevee is featured on variousPokémon-related merchandise.[98][99][100]It is the mascot ofPokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!Eevee has exclusive evolution styles, where each evolution requires special requirements to occur, resulting in 8 different Pokémon. Eevee and its evolutions are sometimes referred to as ""Eeveelutions"". Eevee is mostly found in highly populated areas like cities and towns. Its unstable genes allow it to adapt to most habitats, and even to its trainer, to the point of eventually adopting a face similar to theirs. In generation VIII, it gained a Gigantamax form."
VaporeonShawāzu(シャワーズ)(0134),"Its genes and DNA are nearly identical to water, so it can melt away into it to hide from foes or prey. If its fins begin to mutate, it means rain is coming in a couple of hours. It has the ability to freely control water. It evolves from Eevee using a Water Stone.[101]Vaporeon became the ambassador forWater Dayin Japan in 2023.[102]A popular internetcopypasta, stating that Vaporeon was the most sexually compatible with humans out of all Pokémon species, became amemeamong thePokémoncommunity. Originally posted on4chanin 2018, its spread was attributed to its sudden, overly detailed, unprompted nature. Memes andfan artrelating to the joke became prevalent within the community following its original posting.[103]"
JolteonSandāsu(サンダース)(0135),"It accumulates negative ions in the air to dish out 10,000 volt discharges. It is a moody Pokémon, easily becoming sad or angry, and its spiky fur can be launched to pierce enemies when it bristles. Jolteon's cells emit a low amount of electricity, which is amplified by its needle-like fur. If its hair stands on end, it is about to discharge. The crackling sound of electricity can be heard when it exhales."
FlareonBūsutā(ブースター)(0136),"It stores fire over 1,650 °F inside its flame sac, then releases it at over 3,000 °F. Its fur is used to air out its body so it doesn't overheat. An omnivore, it roasts berries and prey before eating them."
PorygonPorigon(ポリゴン)(0137),"Porygon has become notorious for being featured in anepisode of the animethat caused widespread epileptic seizures in Japanese viewers.[104]Created in 1995, it is made entirely of programming code. It can enter cyberspace at will. People theorized it could go into outer space, though no Porygon has managed to achieve this so far. It has no heartbeat and does not need to eat, though it can eat if food is given. Because of this, people are eager to test it in any environment. Porygon is copy-protected so it cannot be duplicated. It was made with the best technology of 1995, so it has become outdated compared to Pokémon likeGenesectandType: Null. It is still useful incyberspace, as it goes around making sure no suspicious data exists."
OmanyteOmunaito(オムナイト)(0138),"Omanyte is an ancient Pokémon that has been regenerated from Helix Fossils by people using modern science. If attacked by an enemy, it withdraws to its hard shell. It can use air stored inside its shell to rise or fall in water. Omanyte lived in ancient seas. Archeops and Carracosta have been known to prey on it.. The fossils Omanyte have been resurrected from are excavated from areas that were once large oceans. Because some Omanyte manage to escape after being restored or are released into the wild by people, it is gradually becoming an invasive species."
OmastarOmusutā(オムスター)(0139),"Omastar is commonly referred to as ""Lord Helix"" within the community, as a reference toTwitch Plays Pokémon, where the Pokémon was seen as a good-luck charm.[105]Omastar uses its tentacles to capture its prey. It is believed that it went extinct because its shell grew too large and heavy, causing its movements to become too slow and clumsy. Once wrapped around its prey, it never lets go as it attacks by tearing into it with the sharp beaks that ring its mouth."
KabutoKabuto(カブト)(0140),"Kabuto is an ancient Pokémon that has been regenerated from a Dome Fossil. However, in extremely rare cases, living examples have been discovered, being identical to their 300 million year-old counterparts. It is said to have inhabited ancient beaches. It protects itself using its hard shell and glowing red eyes."
KabutopsKabutopusu(カブトプス)(0141),"Kabutops were aggressive prehistoric Pokémon that inhabited warm seas. They swam underwater to hunt for prey in ancient times. It was apparently in the process of evolving from being a water-dweller to living on land, as evident from the beginnings of change in its gills and legs. The exact cause of its extincion is unknown. It swims at speeds of roughly 29 knots, closing in on prey and tearing at its foes with sickle-like forelegs, and drains the foe's body fluids entirely. The discarded body parts become food for other Pokémon. In the water, it tucks in its limbs to become more compact, then it wiggles its shell to swim faster."
AerodactylPutera(プテラ)(0142),"A vicious prehistoric Pokémon, it goes for its opponents' throats with its serrated, saw-like fangs that shred the skin of even Steel-type Pokémon. It went extinct, but it was resurrected by taking its DNA from an Old Amber. It flies by spreading its wings and gliding though the skies, to the point of being referred to as their king. A widely accepted theory is that it went extinct due to a meteor impact. Despite its strength in the air, it is weak and slow on the ground. Even modern technology is still unable to make a truly perfect specimen. It is based on pterodactyls and dragons or wyverns. It gained aMega Evolutionin generation VI."

The naming conventions for this trio are based on their type – Arctic, Zap and Molt – along with 1, 2, 3 in Spanish –uno, dos, tresrespectively.[10]It is said to appear to doomed people who are lost in icy mountains and guide them out. The flapping of Articuno's wings can chill the air around it and cause blizzards.

ZapdosSandā(サンダー)(0145),"It is part of the Legendary Bird Trio. Its design is inspired by the Indigenous North American myth of thethunderbird.[28]It is said to cause and appear from dark and gray clouds in the sky while shedding lightning from its wings.

DratiniMiniryū(ミニリュウ)(0147),"A Dratini continually molts and sloughs off its old skin almost daily. It does so because the life energy within its body steadily builds to reach uncontrollable levels. This allows Dratini to grow longer and longer, even reaching 6 feet in length. In some regions, boots made from the tanned cast-off skin of Dratini are a luxury item. The small lump on a Dratini's forehead is actually an underdeveloped horn. After a 10-hour struggle, a fisherman was finally able to pull one up and confirm its existence. Though still weak, it dwells near bodies of rapidly flowing water, such as the plunge pools of waterfalls to protect it while it repeatedly sheds its skin. It eats whatever food sinks down, and lives a quiet and happy life."
DragonairHakuryū(ハクリュー)(0148),"Dragonair can grow the wings on its head to fly, but can also fly without them. It stores an enormous amount of energy inside its body, and can alter weather conditions in its vicinity by discharging energy from the crystals on its body. The lakes where Dragonair live are filled with offerings from people and are respected by farmers. Some say that seeing a Dragonair flying around at the start of the year is a sign that one will be healthy all year long."
DragoniteKairyū(カイリュー)(0149),"Capable of circling the globe in just sixteen hours and with the intelligence of a human, tales of this kindhearted Pokémon leading lost and foundering ships to the safety of land are commonplace. It is said that somewhere in the ocean lies an island where Dragonite gather. Its build lets it freely fly over raging seas without trouble to rescue drowning people. Observing this, a ship's captain dubbed it ""the sea incarnate"", and figureheads that resemble Dragonite now decorate the bows of many ships."
MewtwoMyūtsū(ミュウツー)(0150),"It is a playable character inSuper Smash Bros. Melee,Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii UandSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate. Mewtwo originated from the DNA of Mew, mutated by Dr. Fuji in a lab after years of gene splicing. Even though it has powerful psychic abilities, scientists failed to give it a compassionate heart, and it turned vicious as a result. It rests to conserve energy, so that it can unleash its full power in battle. In generation VI, it gained two Mega Evolutions;one adapted for physical attacks, andone adapted for special attacks."
MewMyū(ミュウ)(0151),"This mythical Pokémon is so rare, only a few experts worldwide have found it, though a growing number of people have reportedly seen it recently. It apparently originates from South America. It is said that it appears only to those who have a true heart and a strong passion to see it. Its DNA is said to contain the genetic code of every Pokémon and every move. Because of this, many scientists believe that it is the ancestor of all Pokémon. Its fine, small, and delicate hairs can be viewed with a microscope. It is capable of turning invisible at will so that people are unaware of its presence. It is considered one of the original progenitor Pokémon, as all Pokémon are said to have descended from Mew."
